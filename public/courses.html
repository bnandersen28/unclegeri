This course fulfills the DMV mandate of 14 periods of in-car instruction — split evenly between driving and observing.\n Each day, students will:\n -Drive for 50 minutes under the guidance of a certified instructor.\n -Observe another student for 50 minutes as they drive.\n On the 7th day, students are evaluated on a series of required driving maneuvers prescribed by the Virginia DMV. These include real-world skills such as turning, parking, lane changing, and more. If the student successfully completes this evaluation, they will be issued a temporary paper license(interim license).\nThe DMV will then mail a court date to the student\'s registered home address. At that court session (typically within 6 months), students will receive their permanent driver\'s license.\n\n Sessions typically run Monday-Sunday. Uncle Geri’s driving academy has flexible scheduling and will pick up students from their home, and drop them off after each session.\n The 7-day package costs $300. '
